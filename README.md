## About Neo smartpen

The Neo smartpen is designed to seamlessly integrate the real and digital worlds by transforming what you write on paper - everything from sketches and designs to business meeting notes - to your iOS, Android and Windows devices. It works in tandem with N notebooks, powered by NeoLAB Convergence’s patented Ncode technology and the accompanying application, Neo Notes. Find out more at www.neosmartpen.com
